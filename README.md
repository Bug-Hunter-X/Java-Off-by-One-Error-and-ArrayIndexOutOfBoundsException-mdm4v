# Java Off-by-One Error and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an off-by-one error in array access, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The code attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range, resulting in a runtime exception.  The solution provides a corrected version of the code that prevents the error.

The bug is shown in `bug.java`.  The corrected version is in `bugSolution.java`.
